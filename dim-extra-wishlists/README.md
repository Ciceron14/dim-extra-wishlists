## Recommended Wishlists
For most players, the following wishlist files are going to be the most helpful.

You can use the other files to get a more tailored wish list in DIM: see the next section.
- [Endgame - All Weapons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame/All%20Weapon%20Types/dim_aegis_major-perks.txt): Complete list of all rolls from guns rated A or S in the Endgame Analysis spreadsheet.
- [Endgame Shopping List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame/dim_aegis-shopping_major-perks.txt): Current "Shopping List" tab rolls from the Endgame Analysis sheet. Includes the "use case" comments, and exotics.
- [Speedrunner's Shopping List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Speedrunning/dim_aegis-speedrun.txt): All rolls from weapons in the Speedrunner's Shopping List sheet, excluding those marked as "N/A". Includes the "use case" comments, and exotics.

## More Specific Wishlists
### Trash List
The SPPW (Special & Power weapons) section contains a [Trash List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame/Only%20-%20Special%20%26%20Power%20(SPPW)/dim_aegis-sppw-trashlist.txt) that can be used to highlight the weapons you own that are rated D or lower. They will have a comment recommending alternatives in the same weapon type & energy, if any has been rated A or S.
### Weapon Types
Wishlists for the Endgame Analysis sheet can be split per Weapon Type
- Primaries only
- Ammo dependant weapons only
Or you can use the "All Weapon Types" ones to get all in one wishlist.
### Exclusivity
Wishlists that have "exclusive" in their name only look at the best of the best
- Best in Slot primaries
- S Tier Special & Power weapons
### Perks
Wishlists will mostly only look at "Major Perks" aka the two main traits of a weapon, as this is what Aegis lists in the Endgame Spreadsheet.

However, the Speedrunner's Shopping List sheet does list barrels and mags, which means you can choose the "major-perks" version or get the full, most exclusive one.

## Importing into DIM
To import the wishlists in this repo, or any other, you need to grab the "raw" URL of the one(s) you want.

The raw URL can be found by opening any wishlist's .txt file, then pressing the "raw" button found in the github header above the file. Then simply copy the URL and paste it in DIM's "Settings/Wish List/Add another wish list"
