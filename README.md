You can use the other files to get a more tailored wish list in DIM: see the next section.

## More Specific Wishlists
### Trash List
The SPPW (Special & Power weapons) section contains a [Trash List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame/Only%20-%20Special%20%26%20Power%20(SPPW)/dim_aegis-sppw-trashlist.txt) that can be used to highlight the weapons you own that are rated D or lower. They will have a comment recommending alternatives in the same weapon type & energy, if any has been rated A or S.
### Combo List
The SPPW (Special & Power weapons) section contains a [Combos Wishlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame/Only%20-%20Special%20%26%20Power%20(SPPW)/dim_aegis-sppw-combos_major-perks.txt) that can be used for collection purposes. It lists the highest rated Heavy & Special weapons for each type & element (for example, best Stasis Shotgun, etc.)

## Endgame Analysis Split Wishlists
### Weapon Types
Wishlists for the Endgame Analysis Spreadsheet can be split per Weapon Type
- Primaries only
- Ammo dependant weapons only
Or you can use the "All Weapon Types" ones to get all in one wishlist.
### Exclusivity
Wishlists that have "exclusive" in their name only look at the best of the best
- Best in Slot primaries
- S Tier Special & Power weapons

## More General Information
### Perks
Wishlists will mostly only look at "Major Perks" aka the two main traits of a weapon, as this is what Aegis lists in the Endgame Spreadsheet.

However, the Speedrunner's Shopping List sheet does list barrels and mags, which means you can choose the "major-perks" version or get the full, most exclusive one.

## Importing into DIM
To import the wishlists in this repo, or any other, you need to grab the "raw" URL of the one(s) you want.

The raw URL can be found by opening any wishlist's .txt file, then pressing the "raw" button found in the github header above the file. Then simply copy the URL and paste it in DIM's "Settings/Wish List/Add another wish list"
