If you want more control over what shows in your DIM Wishlist, more information on the files available can be found in the following sections of the README. They should allow you to curate your preferred sources with precision.

## Endgame Analysis Split Wishlists
### Weapon Types
Wishlists for the Endgame Analysis Spreadsheet can be split per Ammo Type. Use the folders to find them.
You can use the combined ones from the root of the Endgame Analysis folder to get all slots in one wishlist instead.

### Exclusivity
Wishlists that have "exclusive" in their name only look at S tier rated weapons. Use them if you do not want to see A tier weapons in your wishlist.

## More Endgame Specific Wishlists
### Trash Lists
Each slot in the Endgame Analysis section contains a Trash List that can be used to highlight the weapons you own that are rated D or lower. They will have a comment recommending alternatives in the same weapon type & energy, if any has been rated A or S.

Note that it would be possible for a gun to be in the Trash List but still have a roll in the Combo or Archetype lists (see below). Example: if some day the highest rate "Lightweight Scout" or "Strand SMG" etc. is only D Tier.

### Combo Lists
The Endgame Analysis sections contain Combo Wishlists that can be used for collection purposes. They list the highest rated weapon for each type & element (for example, best Stasis Shotgun, etc.)

### Archetypes Lists
The Endgame Analysis sections contain Archetype Wishlists that can be used for collection purposes. They list the highest rated weapon for each type & archetype (for example, best Slug Shotgun, etc.)

[Get the full one here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame%20Analysis/dim_aegis_endgame-archetypes.txt) or grab an ammo type-specific one from the folders.


## Boss Damage & Speedrun Lists Information
### Perks
While Endgame wishlists will only look at "Major Perks" aka the two main traits of a weapon, (as this is what Aegis lists in the Endgame Spreadsheet), the Speedrunner's Shopping List and Boss Damage sheets do list barrels and mags.

As a result, you can choose the standard wishlist for these, or a less grindy "Major Perks" version that only takes into account major perks.
