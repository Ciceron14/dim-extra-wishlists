## Quick Start - Recommended Wishlists
For most players, the following wishlist files are likely to be the most helpful.

You can use the other files to get a more tailored wish list in DIM: see the next section.
- [Endgame - All A & S Tier Weapons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame%20Analysis/dim_aegis_endgame.txt): Complete list of all rolls from guns rated A or S in the Endgame Analysis spreadsheet.
- [Endgame Shopping List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Endgame%20Analysis/Shopping%20List/dim_aegis_endgame-shopping_list.txt): Current "Shopping List" tab rolls from the Endgame Analysis sheet. Includes the "use case" comments, and exotics.
- [Boss Damage Equipment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ciceron14/dim-extra-wishlists/main/Aegis%20Spreadsheets%20Wishlists/Aegis%20Boss%20Damage/dim_aegis-bosses.txt): All weapons (with rolls if relevant) and armor in the Boss Damage 'Equipment' sheet. Includes the "use case" comments, and exotics.

If you want more control over what shows in your DIM Wishlist, you can browse the folders in this repo to find more specific versions of the Endgame Analysis wishlist. See details below.

## Endgame Analysis Split Wishlists
### Weapon Types
Wishlists for the Endgame Analysis Spreadsheet can be split per Ammo Type. Use the folders to find them.
You can use the combined ones from the root of the Endgame Analysis folder to get all slots in one wishlist instead.

### Exclusivity
Wishlists that have "exclusive" in their name only look at S tier rated weapons. Use them if you do not want to see A tier weapons in your wishlist.

## More Endgame Specific Wishlists
### Trash Lists
Each slot in the Endgame Analysis section contains a Trash List that can be used to highlight the weapons you own that are rated D or lower. They will have a comment recommending alternatives in the same weapon type & energy, if any has been rated A or S.

Note that it would be possible for a gun to be in the Trash List but still have a roll in the Combo or Archetype lists (see below). Example: if some day the highest rate "Lightweight Scout" or "Strand SMG" etc. is only D Tier.

### Combo Lists
The Endgame Analysis sections contain Combo Wishlists that can be used for collection purposes. They list the highest rated weapon for each type & element (for example, best Stasis Shotgun, etc.)

### Archetypes Lists
The Endgame Analysis sections contain Archetype Wishlists that can be used for collection purposes. They list the highest rated weapon for each type & archetype (for example, best Slug Shotgun, etc.)

## Boss Damage & Speedrun Lists Information
### Perks
While Endgame wishlists will only look at "Major Perks" aka the two main traits of a weapon, (as this is what Aegis lists in the Endgame Spreadsheet), the Speedrunner's Shopping List and Boss Damage sheets do list barrels and mags.

As a result, you can choose the standard wishlist for these, or a less grindy "Major Perks" version that only takes into account major perks.

## Importing into DIM
To import the wishlists in this repo, or any other, you need to grab the "raw" URL of the one(s) you want.

The raw URL can be found by opening any wishlist's .txt file, then pressing the "raw" button found in the github header above the file. Then simply copy the URL and paste it in DIM's "Settings/Wish List/Add another wish list"
